letters, characters and digits are global varibles

dynamic array or vector is implemented

vector_init -> initializes vector struct array
vector_total -> returns total length of vector
vector_resize -> resizes the vector
vector_add -> adds elements to vector
vector_get -> get a specific element from the vector array
vector_free -> free allocated memory to vector

generate_letters -> generates a-z and A-Z list
generate_digits -> generates 0-9 list
generate_characters -> generates acceptable character list or mergers digits and letters

in_letters -> checks whether a character is in letter list
in_digits -> checks whether a character is in digits list
in_chars -> checks whether a character is in character list

get_identifier -> returns identifier name from the substring given as a parameter
get_ints -> returns integer value from the substring given as a parameter
get_tokens -> takes a line as an input and saves all tokens to vector class and finally prints each token from vector 

main -> read input from input.mk file and prints output
